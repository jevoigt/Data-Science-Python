# Data-Science-Python
Different data analysis and machine learning methods written in python.

This repository includes files across various assignments / projects within the jupyter lab environment and written in python. 

These files are different scripts that display experience with differnt data analysis and machine learning techniques with various datasets, in different forms.
There are different exploration methods used, as well as supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods being employed simultaneously. There are also files that inlclude the connection and use of "big data" within a mySQL server with various queries being written. 

Please note that much of this code was not originally intended to be provided for and/or used by anyone but myself or a professor, so please excuse any lack of 
comments within chunks of code, or possible work flow confusions. The restructuring of these files is a work in progress to make readability better so my work
can become more interpretable to anyone who would like to view these files. The inclusion of other files and projects is ongoing.
